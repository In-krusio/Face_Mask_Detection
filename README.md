Face mask detection uses machine learning and computer vision to determine if individuals are wearing face masks, which is crucial for enforcing public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The process involves several steps:

1. **Image Acquisition**: Capturing images or video frames from cameras.
2. **Pre-processing**: Standardizing and normalizing images, and augmenting data to improve model performance.
3. **Face Detection**: Identifying faces in the images using algorithms like Haar cascades, HOG with SVM, or CNN-based methods like MTCNN.
4. **Mask Detection**: Analyzing detected faces with a trained convolutional neural network to classify whether masks are worn.
5. **Post-processing**: Displaying results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

Key implementation steps include collecting and labeling a dataset, training and validating the model, evaluating its performance, and deploying it for real-time use. Challenges include variability in mask types, lighting conditions, and privacy concerns. Applications range from monitoring public spaces and workplaces to healthcare environments.
